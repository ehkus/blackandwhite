# Black and White

## Author: Elizabeth Kuszmaul

This Chrome extension allows users to visually simplify web pages by turning all background colors to white and all text colors to black on the current page. This feature can be activated and deactivated using the "Enable" and "Disable" buttons available on the popup after clicking the Black and White icon.

The keyboard shortcut Ctrl-Shift-0 will run the black and white effect, while Ctrl-Shift-1 will reload the page and remove it. (On Mac, the Ctrl turns to Command.)
